Discord token checker



Hi there, gladly presenting you - MrTokenChecker, a tool iwth GUI to check your Discord tokens status, sort them save in the individual files and much more :)

Supports proxy/proxyless mode, proxy format is login:pass@host:port
Suports custom input paterns, input patterns with no email, or no pass, will scrape emails for you( in case if you have tokens in token:password or token: format)

Cannot really write a constructive readme - all the functions are well explained in popups and the whole programm is pretty much self explanatory.

Enjoy :)
